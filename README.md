# Production OOP

The Production OOP program is a mock manufacturing management
application that makes use of several tenets of object oriented
design and programming.

## Getting Started

To use this program, simply include the package files in your Java project and instantiate objects using the subclasses of the **Product** abstract class, which implments the **Item** and **Comparable<>** interfaces. The two primary class types used to create objects are **AudioPlayer** and **MoviePlayer** which both implement the **MultimediaControls** interface. The **MoviePlayer** class also includes an inner class **Screen** to store the details of the built-in display.
The intended use is to instantiate several objects of both **AudioPlayer** and **MoviePlayer** types and store into one ArrayList, which may be sorted because of the implementation of the **Comparable** interface.


### Prerequisites

This program should run on any modern JRE version (8+).

### Opening in IDE (tested in IntelliJ IDEA Ulitimate 2018.2)

Simply import the **com.wyattbyroade.productionoop** package into a new or existing project and use the following syntax to instantiate objects:
```java
AudioPlayer audioplayer1 = new AudioPlayer(String name, String audioSpecification);
```
\- or - 
```java
Screen screenParam = new Screen(String resolution, int refreshrate, int responsetime);

MoviePlayer moviePlayer1 = new MoviePlayer(String nameInput, Screen screenParam, MonitorType monitorType);
```
### Installation and Use

Clone repository from github: git clone https://github.com/wabyroade/ProductionOOP.git

* Navigate to production output folder of java compiler:
```
cd [repository_root]/out/production/ProductionOOP
```
* Run the java command with the fully qualified name of the driver class as the argument:
```
java com.wyattbyroade.productionoop.Main
```
Modification of ProcessFiles.java may be necessary to account for different platforms.
#### Upon running, the user will be prompted to enter their full name and department Id:
(Follow specifications in JPP document)

Please enter your first and last name: 
Please enter the department ID: 


#### Upon entering employee information, the user will be presented with a menu that will guide the user through
#### product creation and viewing
```
Root Menu: 
What would you like to do?:
1-Add New Product
2-Display Previous Products
3-Display Production Statistics
4-Display Production Log
5-Exit

```

## Application Design


### Class Diagram (generated by IntelliJ IDEA)
![Class diagram generated by IntelliJ IDEA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wabyroade/ProductionOOP/master/Package%20productionoop.png)

### Methods specified by Item interface:
```java
*  String manufacturer = "OracleProduction";
*  void setProductionNumber(int productionNumberInput);
*  void setName(String nameInput);
*  String getName();
*  Date getManufactureDate();
*  int getSerialNumber();
```

### Methods specified by MultimediaControl interface:
```java
*  void play();
*  void stop();
*  void previous();
*  void next();
```

### Methods specified by the ScreenSpec interface:
```java
*  String getResolution();
*  int getRefreshRate();
*  int getResponseTime();
```
## Educational Concepts:
* **Interfaces** - Three interfaces were created to ensure consistent operation and interaction across multiple class types.
* **Abstract Classes** - The use of the **Product** abstract class gives the inherited concrete classes certain common fields and methods.
* **Polymorphism** - The above-mentioned abstract class and interfaces allow the objects to be handled with the same data types and methods.
* **Generics** - Certain data storage types and methods have been designed to work with different types of objects.
* **Enum types** - The ItemType and MonitorType enums are reference types used to define a set of constants for the types of objects and utilize them.
* **File and folder operations** - Using java.nio.file modules to create, append and read files and folders
